Well, I haven't done much in the last year software wise. I have been playing around a bit with the network - I have a "new" router and have 10Gb fiber running on it to the switch. I also retired the very old PC that was serving as my TrueNAS server. It was running TrueNAS Core and I decided it was time to try and move to Scale. I almost bought an HP tower to use as that seemed perfect. But
* I couldn't justify spending the money
* I had a perfectly good machine doing nothing

The only problem was that the perfectly good machine is a small Dell mid tower with no drive cages and a very short supply of SATA power. After buying a splitter and an NVME drive and using some velcro to attach a drive cage, I was on my way. I installed Scale, moved the drives over from the old machine, and everything worked great. I'm really liking Scale. I have a bunch of cleanup to do on our files and then I'm going to implement a much better backup system. I've tested Google Drive and rsync to my new Ubuntu desktop and things are working well.
